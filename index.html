      <p id="hook">Have you ever wanted to finally win that arm-wrestling match against your sister?
        Do you ever feel incompetent, weak, or frustrated that your physical abilities have limitations?
        Perhaps, you've secretly daydreamed about having one or more of those limitations removed.
        Perhaps, even, you've thought long and hard about working out some more to gain those muscles you promised you'd gain two years ago. 
        All of these thoughts over ice cream.</p>
      <br>
      <p id="tribute">Well, we're changing that now. That toxic mentality of yours.
        I'm sure you've heard of One-Punch Man, aka Saitama. He's a bald man in his mid-twenties who fights "bad guys" for fun.
        We're not here to turn you bald. We're here to reveal to you what Genos, Saitama's fanboy,
        would kill to know: Saitama's secret to surpassing the physical limitations of a human.</p>
      <br>
      <p id="offering">Just kidding. Unless you think doing 100 pushups, 100 situps, 100 air squats,
        and a 10-km run every day until you go bald is the secret formula, there has yet to be an explicit method revealed to
        the public. I apologize, but even Saitama himself appears clueless as to how he achieved insurmountable strength and speed.
        However, I encourage you to uncover this secret yourself. Below, I've attached a link to Saitama's training session.</p>
